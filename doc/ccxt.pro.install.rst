How To Install

JavaScript
----------

.. code:: shell

   # in your project directory

   # if you're using Git/HTTPS authentication
   npm install git+https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt.pro.git

   # if you are connecting to GitHub with SSH
   npm install ssh://git@github.com/kroitor/ccxt.pro.git
   # or
   npm install git@ssh://github.com/kroitor/ccxt.pro.git
   # or if you have git and github.com in your ~/.ssh/config
   npm install ssh://github.com/kroitor/ccxt.pro.git

JavaScript Dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding CCXT Pro as a dependency to ``package.json`` in your Node.js project or package is done automatically by the above commands. To add it manually list it in your ``package.json`` among your ``dependencies`` or ``devDependencies`` as usual:

.. code:: javascript

   // package.json
   {
     // ...
     "dependencies": {
       "ccxt.pro": "git+https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt.pro.git"
     }
     // ...
   }

Running ``npm install`` in the same folder after adding the above to ``package.json`` will install CCXT Pro to your ``node_modules/``. To update it later run ``npm update ccxt.pro``.

Python

.. code:: shell

   # if you're using Git/HTTPS authentication
   pip3 install git+https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt.pro.git#subdirectory=python

   # if you are connecting to GitHub with SSH
   pip3 install git+ssh://git@github.com/kroitor/ccxt.pro.git#subdirectory=python

           # install the most recent version
           'ccxtpro @ git+https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt.pro.git#subdirectory=python'
           # install a specific version number
           # 'ccxtpro @ git+https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt.pro.git@0.1.13#subdirectory=python'
